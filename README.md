I set out to create a website to display the project I have created so far.

## Description

This is a project I created as a student at Noroff. It is a portfolio of all the works I have created as a frontend development student at Noroff. It is meant to showcase the skills I have in building website wirh HTML, CSS and Vanilla Javascript. It is also a place to show that I can design websites as these are all my own design.

## Built With

2. Install Live Server in VS Code (or equivalent if using another IDE) and then it can be run from within.
